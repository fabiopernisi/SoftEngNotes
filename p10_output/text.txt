\section*{LECTURE 10}

\subsection*{SOFTWARE LICENSES}

\subsection*{Closed-source software}
Most end-user software is closed-source (proprietary).

\begin{itemize}
    \item The executable is distributed to customers.
    \item The source code is either
    \begin{itemize}
        \item never revealed (most commonly), or
        \item only made available to select customers (rarely).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% [TBD] Placeholder for the non-textual elements that may exist on the original slide, which can't be represented in LaTeX.


% Packages and document configuration commands are omitted since the instruction specifies to avoid them.

% Example of closed-source software section
\section*{Example of closed-source software}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating systems: Microsoft Windows; Android, iOS, MacOS (except kernel)
    \item Office suites: Microsoft 365, iWork
    \item Creative software: Adobe suite, Autodesk suite, Final Cut Pro, Pro Tools, Logic Pro
    \item Development software: Visual Studio, XCode (except compiler)
    \item Collaboration software: Zoom, Teams, Skype, Slack, Discord
    \item Server-side and enterprise software: Microsoft IIS, SAP, OpenAI GPT-4
    \item Almost all videogames
    \item Almost all mobile apps
\end{itemize}

% Free software section
\section*{Free software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``free'' as in freedom (not ``free lunch'')
    \item defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF, est. 1985)
    \item software attached with a \textit{license} (uses copyright law)
    \item gives \textit{freedoms} (rights) to the \textit{user}, to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item run the software as they wish
        \item study and modify the software as they wish
        \item redistribute (original and modified versions)
    \end{itemize}
    \item based on the philosophy that all \textit{software should be free} to protect users
    \item the ``GNU'' project is FSF's software collection
\end{itemize}

% Open-source software section
\section*{Open-source software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI, est. 1998)
    \item software attached with a \textit{license} (uses copyright law)
    \item specifies how software can be \textit{distributed}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item no restrictions on redistribution
        \begin{itemize}
            \item no discrimination against specific users, fields, products, other software, other technologies
        \end{itemize}
        \item source code must be available
        \item derived works must be allowed
        \item but modifications can be required to be clearly delineated
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% [TBD] token is used to replace non-textual elements that cannot be represented in LaTeX.


% Using itemize to create bullet points
\section*{FSF vs. OSI}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{FSF:} for the user's sake, all software \textit{should be free} on ethical grounds -- free software licenses are a means to that end
  \item \textbf{OSI:} help businesses and developers publish and disseminate their open-source software -- pragmatically, we do not want to add hurdles if they impair practical use
\end{itemize}

\section*{In practice?}
The FSF and OSI each maintain a list of ``approved'' license.

Most FSF-approved \textit{free software} licenses are also OSI-approved \textit{open-source} licenses. And vice-versa.

The difference lies in the licenses each organization \textit{promotes}.

\section*{The ``baseline'' FSF license}
The GNU General Public License (GPL):
\begin{itemize}
  \item any user who receives the executable must be provided the source code as well upon request
  \item any derivative work is automatically covered by the GPL (the GPL is ``viral'')
  \item dynamic linking with GPL software counts as derivative work
\end{itemize}


\section*{Amended FSF licenses}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The ``more permissive'' \textbf{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item adds exception to allow dynamic linking with non-GPL software
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item The ``more restrictive'' \textbf{GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item definition of ``user'' includes over-the-network interactions
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Typical open-source licenses}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Most popular: Apache License, BSD License, MIT License
  \item ``permissive licenses'': fewer constraints on derivative work
  \begin{itemize}
    \item unmodified parts still covered by the original license
    \item but modified parts are not, can even be closed source
  \end{itemize}
  \item some require acknowledgement of the original work (authors and/or project)
  \item differences among permissive licenses are minor (but important to lawyers)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Example projects}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ``free software'' (GPL-type licenses)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Linux kernel, \textbf{GPL}
    \item GNU project, \textbf{GPL}
    \item gcc, \textbf{GPL}
    \item glibc (gccâ€™s standard C library), \textbf{LGPL}
    \item git, \textbf{GPL}
    \item gmp, \textbf{LGPL}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item ``open source'' (permissive licenses)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Apache web server, \textbf{Apache}
    \item NGINX web server, \textbf{BSD}
    \item LLVM, \textbf{Apache}
    \item Chrome (more precisely: chromium), \textbf{BSD}
    \item Node.js, Angular, React, \textbf{MIT}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{End-user cost}

Whether or not customers pay for software is orthogonal to source availability.

\begin{tabular}{>{\bfseries}l l l}
cost & closed-source & free / open-source \\
\hline
0 & TikTok, Whatsapp, Discord & Chrome, Gimp, VLC, Blender \\
> 0 & Photoshop, Maya, Ableton & Red Hat Enterprise Linux \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{5mm} % Adjust vertical spacing as necessary
\section*{Commercial, non-commercial}

Whether or not developers are commercial entities is orthogonal to source availability.

\begin{tabular}{>{\bfseries}l l l}
developers & closed-source & free / open-source \\
\hline
non-commercial & (most amateur code until 2010s, some government software, legacy scientific software) & GNU system (Free software foundation), Blender, Krita, LibreOffice \\
commercial & Microsoft Windows, Microsoft 365, iWork, Adobe suite, Autodesk, \ldots & Chrome, Ubuntu, Red Hat, NGINX, Docker, GitLab, Redis, LLVM \\
\end{tabular}

% The asterisk is used in text mode, not math mode, to avoid confusion with multiplication symbol
*the distinction between commercial and non-commercial is often blurry

\vspace{5mm} % Adjust vertical spacing as necessary
\section*{How can commercial software be free / open-source?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item software has zero price, sell support and services (Ubuntu, Red Hat, NGINX)
    \item software costs money, convince customers not to redistribute it (Red Hat)
    \item open-core: basic functionality is open-source, sell advanced features (NGINX)
    \item open-sourced software accesses proprietary services (Chrome)
    \item open-sourced software is not core business (LLVM)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Use cases}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Closed-source:
  \begin{itemize}[label={--}]
    \item source code is your ``secret sauce''
    \item customers willing to pay
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Open-source permissive licenses:
  \begin{itemize}[label={--}]
    \item encourage wider adoption
    \item encourage commercial entities to participate
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Free software GPL-type licenses:
  \begin{itemize}[label={--}]
    \item protect users (ethical grounds)
    \item force downstream developers to reciprocate
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Share source code, but do not give any right to modify (limited usefulness)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Patents}

\noindent In most countries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contrary to copyright law (protects creative processes) patents are not a fundamental right
  \item Patents are a pragmatic compromise for promoting innovation.
  
  \noindent The bargain is:
  \begin{itemize}[label={--}]
    \item Share your innovation with the patent office (as opposed to keeping it secret)
    \item Get N-year exclusivity on commercialization
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Patents and software innovation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Software innovation is quicker: N years is like centuries
  \item Ideas are cheap, execution is everything
  \item Software is close to mathematics (discovered, not invented)
  \item Patent disclosures do not include code! They don't actually help anyone.
\end{itemize}
