# SoftEngNotes
This repository contains the file with the lecture notes for the course "20875 - Software Engineering" at Bocconi University.

## Contributing
The file skeleton.txt contains a sample latex format that includes several packages (probably all that you would ever need), including 'hyperref', to make the table of contents clickable.\\
Please adopt the following convention when contributing to the latex notes:
- every Lecture represents a `section`
- every title that uses a whole slide is a `subsection`
- every title followed by some text in the same slide is a `subsubsection`
- every minor title or example is a `paragraph` (i.e. `\paragraph{minor_title}`)
